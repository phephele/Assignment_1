She's the coolest cat in town.\n![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11805474/painblogr/biostats/images/octocat.png)\n\n```{r setup, include=FALSE}\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)\n```\n\n## R Markdown\n\nThis is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.\n\nWhen you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:\n\n```{r cars}\nsummary(cars)\n```\n\n## Including Plots\n\nYou can also embed plots, for example:\n\n```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}\nplot(pressure)\n```\n\nNote that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.\n",
